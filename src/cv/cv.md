## Work Experience


### **Junior Software Developer**

**2023 - Present**
**Arksoft**

As a Junior Software Developer at Arksoft, I have played a important role in the development and enhancement of ERP and custom systems for a diverse range of clients. My expertise lies in web
application development, primarily using ASP.NET MVC, and I am proud to have introduced React.js to the company's tech stack, further advancing our capabilities.

I work closely with our clients and project managers to define our client’s needs and produce high quality software to improve their business functions.

I am dedicated to staying updated with the latest trends and best practices in software development, including clean architecture, modern web UI practices, and new languages, ensuring that Arksoft
remains at the forefront of technology and delivers cutting-edge solutions.

I have succeeded in taking over management of a decade long project for one of our closest clients, delivering multiple successful upgrades and bug fixes.

**Primary technologies**: .NET Core/Framework, ASP.Net, React, Next.js, TypeScript, MSSQL Server


## Education


### **BSc Honours Computer Science/Information Systems**

**2022**
**Nelson Mandela University**

My year project was titled, “Investigation into Procedural Generation of 2D Platformer Game Levels”. I developed an algorithm using graph theory and the Wave Function Collapse algorithm to create
procedurally generated game levels.

My coursework included AI, Evolutionary Computing, Data Warehousing, VR and Game Development, Usability Engineering, Compiler Construction, Electronic Commerce, and Project Management.

My research was funded in part by the NRF.

## Side Projects


### kjarmie.co.za

I developed and deployed my personal portfolio, CV, and blog, to serve as a digital CV, and to learn web development. I chose Astro as my framework because it delivers highly performant websites with
the speed of a static site generator, but without the tedium of creating a website from scratch.

Technologies: Astro, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS

### Protea UI

A new project I am starting to create re-useable UI elements based off the WAI-ARIA specification.

I found, when building my website, that there are not many options for pure html/web-component libraries that fill the need for slightly more complex UI components like accordions, popovers, vertical
separators, etc. Most good ones, like Radix UI are tied to framework like React. Bootstrap has many of the features I am looking for, but its CSS class approach can cause conflict with Tailwind, my
CSS styler of choice.

So, my goal is to produce an open source, accessible, un-styled, component library that can be used by any framework, or pure HTML.
